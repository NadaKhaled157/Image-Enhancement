# Image Filtering and Edge Detection Toolkit

<p align="justify"> A comprehensive image processing toolkit that performs a wide range of operations including noise addition, low-pass filtering, edge detection, histogram analysis, normalization, thresholding, and frequency domain filtering. This project is developed as part of an academic assignment focused on fundamental computer vision techniques.</p>

## Objectives

Using standard grayscale and color images, the following tasks are implemented:

1. **Add Additive Noise**  
   - Types: Uniform, Gaussian, Salt & Pepper
2. **Filter Noisy Images**  
   - Low-pass filters: Average, Gaussian, Median
3. **Edge Detection**  
   - Algorithms: Sobel, Roberts, Prewitt, and Canny
4. **Histogram Analysis**  
   - Draw histogram and distribution curve
5. **Image Equalization**  
   - Enhance contrast using histogram equalization
6. **Image Normalization**  
   - Normalize pixel intensities to a specific range
7. **Thresholding Techniques**  
   - Apply both local and global thresholding
8. **Color to Grayscale Transformation**  
   - Convert images and plot RGB histograms and cumulative distribution function (CDF)
9. **Frequency Domain Filtering**  
   - Apply High-pass and Low-pass filters in the frequency domain
10. **Hybrid Image Construction**
   - Combine high-frequency and low-frequency components from different images
